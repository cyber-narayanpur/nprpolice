More than 70% of the total population is tribal people, such as Gond tribe, Maria, Muria, Dhruv, Bhatra, Hala tribe etc.The main means of movement in the district is the road link which connects Kanker from north direction and in the east to Kondagaon. Narayanpur road is the main road of Sonpur, 26 km. Narayanpur is situated at Ravaghat, 18 km away on the main road on the Anantgadh (Kanker) route, which is covered with high mountain ranges, green furnishings. The “NIBRA” river in the district Narayanpur flows in the Abujhmad area through the district Kanker and the “KUKUR” river is considered to be the life-long river for the people of the region.

Social and Economic Status:
In the four directions of the district Narayanpur, the elaborate Uttung is covered with green mountain ranges and rugged forests. The lifestyle of tribals in the district is simple. Due to illiteracy, the practice of superstitions is in existence. Due to tribal culture extinction, tribal society is celebrated with great importance, and celebrates it with great fanfare in the form of festival / festivities. The Orchha tehsil of district Narayanpur is a world famous area of about 4 thousand square kilometers, called ABUJHMAD. In Bastar, the meaning of MAD means “HILL OR MOUNTAIN” and ABUJH means “which can not be extinguished”, in fact it is difficult to quench or understand the quote of this region and this. This area is mainly affected by the Naxalite problem, which has not been able to develop the area; but now speedily developing narayanpur district specially security cover by State Police, State Arms Force and Central Arms Force. 237 villages of Abujhmad Where there is no means of transport, education, health, drinking water, and the means of electricity are negligible. Residents of Abujhmad are still joining the mainstream of the state in terms of living conditions. The journey here is set by crossing the high hills and river banks. Abujhmadia tribe resides in this inaccessible area. This area is a mountain range covered by dense trees, there are small mountains in entire Abujhmad, lack of plain land here, the revenue survey of the entire Abujhmad zone has not been done till date. The lack of road and communication system is also a major problem. Due to the spread of the population in remote areas, there is lack of accessibility to every settlement. For removable of Naxalism, road extension in such areas is also one of the main reasons for connecting roads and bridges to remote areas and extension of communication medium as well as traffic there is a need to increase.

Police and Security Forces:
Police, Chhattisgarh Armed Force and Central Armed Forces have a special contribution in the all-round development, progress, security and peace of Bastar. Development in Naxal areas cannot be imagined without the contribution, dedication and martyrdom of the jawans. In the district there are 15 Police Station Narayanpur, Benur, Edka, Kukdajhor, Kurushnar, Kohkameta, Sonpur, Farsagon, Jharaghati, Dhoudai, Chhote Dongar, Dhanora, Orcha, Bharanda and AJK Narayanpur.
